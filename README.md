# Movie-Recommendation-Machine-Learning-
A Personal Project

I wanted to learn about machine learning concepts and this project is intended to be an introduction.

This project is a movie recommendation engine built in Python and scikit-learn. It applies machine learning concepts and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques-such as extraction, vectorization, and similarity metrics to compare movies based on their metadata.

To run the code on terminal:
```
python movie_recommender.py
```
Then from there, follow the instructions on screen. 

Enjoy!
